                <p>General health and wellness encompass a wide range of
                    factors that contribute to your overall well-being.
                    It's not just about the absence of disease, but rather a
                    state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being.
                    Here's a breakdown of key areas</p>

                        unprocessed foods like fruits, vegetables,
                        lean proteins, and whole grains. Limit processed foods,

                        Regular Exercise: Aim for at least 150 minutes
                        of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity
                        aerobic activity per week, plus muscle-strengthening activities
                        at least two days a week. Find activities you enjoy to make it
                        sustainable.

                    <li>
                        Adequate Sleep: Most adults need 7-9 hours of quality sleep

                        relaxing bedtime routine.

                        your health are interconnected.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Prevention is Key: Focus on
                        proactive strategies to maintain
                        health and prevent illness.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Individualized Needs: What works for
                        one person may not work for another.
                        Pay attention to your own body and needs.

                    <li>
                        Consistency over Perfection: Small, sustainable
                        changes are more effective than drastic,
                        short-lived efforts.

                    <li>Lifelong Journey:
                        Health and wellness is
                        an ongoing process, not
                        a destination.
